# DDL
The acronym **DDL** stands for **Data Definition Language**, which is a series of commands used in SQL to create, modify, and delete database objects.

It is divided into three (3) main commands:

- CREATE -> defines new database objects
- ALTER -> modifies the structure of existing objects
- DROP -> deletes database objects

After mastering **DDL**, check out **DML** **(Data Manipulation Language)** commands like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`.
