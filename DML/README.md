# DML
The acronym **DML** stands for **Data Manipulation Language**, which is a series of commands used in SQL to insert, update, and delete data in database tables.

It is divided into three (3) main commands:

- INSERT - adds new rows of data into a table
- UPDATE - modifies existing data within a table
- DELETE - removes data from a table

After mastering **DML**, check out **DQL** **(Data Query Language)**, which focuses on retrieving data.
